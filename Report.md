# EANBiT 2022 Residential Training Mini Project Report
## Project: Nextflow Pipeline for ONT Long Reads Metatrascriptomic data (ONTmetacriptom-NF).
### Introduction

High throughput sequencing (shotgun and ONT) has accelerated characterization of microbes and their functionality in environment. Most of tools and pipelines are optimized for short reads metatranscriptomics. There are few standardized workflow for metatranscriptomic analysis of long read. In this project we set out to develop a pipeline for Oxford Nanopore reads particularly for metatranscriptomics data.
